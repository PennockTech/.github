## About

Pennock Tech, LLC is an independent technology company based in
Pennsylvania, USA.  Our focus is on security and Internet technologies,
with site reliability work being very common.

Some of our work is public, and presented here.
Much of our work is private to our consultancy clients.

## Ecosystem: Go

Please use the [`go.pennock.tech/PROJECT`](https://go.pennock.tech/)
form to import any modules here.  We consider the use of GitHub to be an
implementation detail which we can change without requiring code changes by
those importing our code.
